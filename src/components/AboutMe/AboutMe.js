            Hello world! I'm Fatemeh. I am a creative full-stack developer,
            currently based in Philadelphia who used to be a research assistant.
            I have a Bachelor's of Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology (Microbiology)
            and a Master of Biotechnology. I love designing, singing, painting ,
            meditating &amp; working out. I also used to teach biology courses to
            college students &amp; supervising their work in the laboratory. Our
            laboratory's focus was on rare dermatology conditions that were
            caused by mutation in different parts of patient's genes and our
            main goals were to find out what causes this conditions to find a
            potential drug a potential drug. My job needs with a lot of
            calculations and working with cell, animals, DNA, RNA &amp; protein. And
            how I became a full-stack developer? One day, I watched a video
            about html and css. I downloaded VS Code and started a mini project
            and when I could see the result in the live server, I fell in love!
            I love design and problem-solving. And I know when you really love
            what you do, you are not actually working, it is fun, satisfaction
            and happiness! That was when I decided to register for UPENN
            Bootcamp to become a full-stack developer.
